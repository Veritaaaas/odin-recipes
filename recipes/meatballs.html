            <p>Swedish meatballs, also known as köttbullar in Swedish, are a popular dish in Sweden and around the world. They are typically made with a combination of ground beef and pork, soaked bread crumbs, milk, onion, egg, and various seasonings. The meatballs are then browned in butter or oil and served in a creamy gravy, often with mashed potatoes, lingonberry jam, and pickled cucumbers.</p>

            <p>The creamy gravy that Swedish meatballs are typically served in is made with beef broth, flour, butter, and heavy cream. It is important to use the pan drippings from browning the meatballs in the gravy, as this will add a significant amount of flavor. The gravy is typically thickened with flour, but it can also be thickened with cornstarch or other starches.</p>
